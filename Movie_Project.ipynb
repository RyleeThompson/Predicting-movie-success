    "The purpose of this notebook is to create a model or models which can predict how successful a movie will be. We are defining success as how much money a movie makes and how many Academy Award wins/ nominations they have. The more money and awards, the greater amount of success. The models will be developped using a regression model to determine the amount of money made and a classification model for number of Oscar wins. The accuracy of these models will be found which wll be used to validate the model(s)."

IMDb website will be used to scrape movie data information pertaining to genre, actors involved and parental rating just to name a few. Additionally, a .csv database file will be used to collect Oscar wins/nomination information for actors and directors as this information is not easily accessible on IMDb. Scraping will be performed using Beautiful Soup and scikit-learn will be used to build the models."

The normalized and non-normalized plots can be seen for the Gaussian Naive Bayes model below. The accuracy is really good for predicting 0 Oscar wins but is very poor at predicting any Osars wins above 0. The data is very skewed with many movies that have 0 Oscar wins so the accuracy seen in the previous code block is not actually as good as it looks."

    "To see if we can improve on the previous results using a Naive Bayes model, a support vector machine is used. This model will be used to see if improvement can be made, specfically in non-linear classification. The kernel `rbf` is used since it is good at predicting non-linear boundaries and from the regression models, it appears as though the features show many non-linear relationships."

    "It was found that decision trees are very good in predicting how much money a movie will make. It does this due to the non-linearity in the spread of data. This non-linear relationship in the data means that a model such as a generalized linear regression model would produce poor results (which was seen previously).\n",

    "From these results classification models were then used to predict the number of Oscar wins. A simple Gaussian Naive Bayes model was used first because it is fast to train (only compare each data point features to the average of the class features) even though it is generally not a very good estimator (it assumes independent features which almost never occurs in real life). The accuracy was found to be high but the data is very skewed to 0 Oscar wins. So the accuracy is not as high as it appears for predicting movies that did win Oscars. An SVM model was then used due to the large non-linearities in the data. From the SVM model, it was seen that the accuracy was better than the Bayes model, however the skew to 0 Oscar wins is even more noticeable, as it didn't predict that any movies would win an Oscar. "
